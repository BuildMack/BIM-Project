# BIM-Project
A building information modelling (BIM) viewer and editor.


Phase 1: BIM VIEWER
This stage is a simple viewer of a 3D model that loads Graphics Library Transmission Format using Node.JS and React. Implements basic camera controls for rotating, zooming, and panning over the model.

  Valuable Information:
  
  What is Three.JS?
  Three.js is a popular JavaScript library that simplifies working with WebGL to render 3D graphics in the browser, and it includes support for displaying glTF models among many other    features. glTF (GL Transmission Format) is a widely used file format for 3D models that is designed to be efficient and easy to use in web applications.
  
  What is WebGL?
  WebGL is a web API that is built into browsers that utilizes a persons own GPU to create visulizations and Three.js just makes it simpler to use and allows you to interact with it      through JS.

Phase 2:
